                Hello, my name is Alfredo Baldoceda ..
              </p>

              <p className="text-zinc-900 dark:text-white font-thin">
                With years of experience in the tech industry, I have built a
                diverse skillset that allows me to take on any technical
                challenge.
              </p>

              <p className="text-zinc-900 dark:text-white text-m sm:text-md font-thin">
                As a systems engineer, I specialize in building infrastructure
                as code and integrating systems. I have also worked in various
                roles such as system administrator, lead DevOps engineer,
                software developer, network administrator and problem solver. My
                experience has given me a deep understanding of the complexities
                of the tech industry and the ability to navigate them with ease.

                Originally from Peru, I received my bachelor's degree in Systems
                Engineering. Before moving to the US in 2003, I already had
                experience working as a Unix/Linux systems and network
                administrator. In 2006, I started working with automation using
                Perl, and in 2010, I began working with configuration management
                using Puppet, transitioning completely to DevOps by 2013 when I
                moved to California to work for VMware.

                In 2015, I took a job as a lead DevOps engineer, focusing on
                AWS, Python, and containers. In 2018, I designed and implemented
                a full-stack application utilizing serverless AWS Amplify,
                Python, and Node.js.

                In 2022, I moved back to the East Coast and continue to look for
                new challenges. My new interest is in AI, and I have been
                training myself on data science. I have worked in different
                industries, such as healthcare, advertising, finance, and
                high-tech virtualization. I have been a system administrator, a
                lead DevOps engineer, a software developer, a network
                administrator, and a problem solver.
